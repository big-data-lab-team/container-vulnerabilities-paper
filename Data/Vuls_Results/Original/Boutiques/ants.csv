CveID Packages PackageVer "CVSS (AC)" Summary
CVE-2009-5155 glibc 2.17-78.el7 LOW "In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.28, parse_reg_exp in posix/regcomp.c misparses alternatives, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) or trigger an incorrect result by attempting a regular-expression match."
CVE-2012-6711 bash 4.2.46-12.el7 LOW "A heap-based buffer overflow exists in GNU Bash before 4.3 when wide characters, not supported by the current locale set in the LC_CTYPE environment variable, are printed through the echo built-in function. A local attacker, who can provide data to print through the ""echo -e"" built-in function, may use this flaw to crash a script or execute code with the privileges of the bash process. This occurs because ansicstr() in lib/sh/strtrans.c mishandles u32cconv()."
CVE-2013-1752 python 2.7.5-18.el7_1.1 MEDIUM "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme, or Java. Python includes modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac and MFC). It was discovered that the Python xmlrpclib module did not restrict the size of gzip-compressed HTTP responses. A malicious XMLRPC server could cause an XMLRPC client using xmlrpclib to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2013-1753) It was discovered that multiple Python standard library modules implementing network protocols (such as httplib or smtplib) failed to restrict the sizes of server responses. A malicious server could cause a client using one of the affected modules to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2013-1752) It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module incorrectly handled URL encoded paths. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute scripts outside of the cgi-bin directory, or disclose the source code of the scripts in the cgi-bin directory. (CVE-2014-4650) An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the buffer() function handled its offset and size arguments. An attacker able to control these arguments could use this flaw to disclose portions of the application memory or cause it to crash. (CVE-2014-7185) A flaw was found in the way the json module handled negative index arguments passed to certain functions (such as raw_decode()). An attacker able to control the index value passed to one of the affected functions could possibly use this flaw to disclose portions of the application memory. (CVE-2014-4616) The Python standard library HTTP client modules (such as httplib or urllib) did not perform verification of TLS/SSL certificates when connecting to HTTPS servers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to hijack connections and eavesdrop or modify transferred data. (CVE-2014-9365) Note: The Python standard library was updated to make it possible to enable certificate verification by default. However, for backwards compatibility, verification remains disabled by default. Future updates may change this default. Refer to the Knowledgebase article 2039753 linked to in the References section for further details about this change. (BZ#1219108) This update also fixes the following bugs: * Subprocesses used with the Eventlet library or regular threads previously tried to close epoll file descriptors twice, which led to an ""Invalid argument"" error. Subprocesses have been fixed to close the file descriptors only once. (BZ#1103452) * When importing the readline module from a Python script, Python no longer produces erroneous random characters on stdout. (BZ#1189301) * The cProfile utility has been fixed to print all values that the ""-s"" option supports when this option is used without a correct value. (BZ#1237107) * The load_cert_chain() function now accepts ""None"" as a keyfile argument. (BZ#1250611) In addition, this update adds the following enhancements: * Security enhancements as described in PEP 466 have been backported to the Python standard library, for example, new features of the ssl module: Server Name Indication (SNI) support, support for new TLSv1.x protocols, new hash algorithms in the hashlib module, and many more. (BZ#1111461) * Support for the ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2 protocol has been added to the ssl library. (BZ#1192015) * The ssl.SSLSocket.version() method is now available to access information about the version of the SSL protocol used in a connection. (BZ#1259421) All python users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these enhancements."

Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac and MFC). It was discovered that the Python xmlrpclib module did not restrict the size of gzip-compressed HTTP responses. A malicious XMLRPC server could cause an XMLRPC client using xmlrpclib to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2013-1753) It was discovered that multiple Python standard library modules implementing network protocols (such as httplib or smtplib) failed to restrict the sizes of server responses. A malicious server could cause a client using one of the affected modules to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2013-1752) It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module incorrectly handled URL encoded paths. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute scripts outside of the cgi-bin directory, or disclose the source code of the scripts in the cgi-bin directory. (CVE-2014-4650) An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the buffer() function handled its offset and size arguments. An attacker able to control these arguments could use this flaw to disclose portions of the application memory or cause it to crash. (CVE-2014-7185) A flaw was found in the way the json module handled negative index arguments passed to certain functions (such as raw_decode()). An attacker able to control the index value passed to one of the affected functions could possibly use this flaw to disclose portions of the application memory. (CVE-2014-4616) The Python standard library HTTP client modules (such as httplib or urllib) did not perform verification of TLS/SSL certificates when connecting to HTTPS servers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to hijack connections and eavesdrop or modify transferred data. (CVE-2014-9365) Note: The Python standard library was updated to make it possible to enable certificate verification by default. However, for backwards compatibility, verification remains disabled by default. Future updates may change this default. Refer to the Knowledgebase article 2039753 linked to in the References section for further details about this change. (BZ#1219108) This update also fixes the following bugs: * Subprocesses used with the Eventlet library or regular threads previously tried to close epoll file descriptors twice, which led to an ""Invalid argument"" error. Subprocesses have been fixed to close the file descriptors only once. (BZ#1103452) * When importing the readline module from a Python script, Python no longer produces erroneous random characters on stdout. (BZ#1189301) * The cProfile utility has been fixed to print all values that the ""-s"" option supports when this option is used without a correct value. (BZ#1237107) * The load_cert_chain() function now accepts ""None"" as a keyfile argument. (BZ#1250611) In addition, this update adds the following enhancements: * Security enhancements as described in PEP 466 have been backported to the Python standard library, for example, new features of the ssl module: Server Name Indication (SNI) support, support for new TLSv1.x protocols, new hash algorithms in the hashlib module, and many more. (BZ#1111461) * Support for the ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2 protocol has been added to the ssl library. (BZ#1192015) * The ssl.SSLSocket.version() method is now available to access information about the version of the SSL protocol used in a connection. (BZ#1259421) All python users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these enhancements."

CVE-2014-8182 openldap 2.4.39-6.el7 HIGH "OpenLDAP is an open-source suite of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) applications and development tools. LDAP is a set of protocols used to access and maintain distributed directory information services over an IP network. The openldap packages contain configuration files, libraries, and documentation for OpenLDAP. A flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP parsed OpenSSL-style cipher strings. As a result, OpenLDAP could potentially use ciphers that were not intended to be enabled. (CVE-2015-3276) This issue was discovered by Martin Poole of the Red Hat Software Maintenance Engineering group. The openldap packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.4.40, which provides a number of bug fixes and one enhancement over the previous version: * The ORDERING matching rules have been added to the ppolicy attribute type descriptions. * The server no longer terminates unexpectedly when processing SRV records. * Missing objectClass information has been added, which enables the user to modify the front-end configuration by standard means. (BZ#1147982) This update also fixes the following bugs: * Previously, OpenLDAP did not properly handle a number of simultaneous updates. As a consequence, sending a number of parallel update requests to the server could cause a deadlock. With this update, a superfluous locking mechanism causing the deadlock has been removed, thus fixing the bug. (BZ#1125152) * The httpd service sometimes terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation fault on the libldap library unload. The underlying source code has been modified to prevent a bad memory access error that caused the bug to occur. As a result, httpd no longer crashes in this situation. (BZ#1158005) * After upgrading the system from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, symbolic links to certain libraries unexpectedly pointed to locations belonging to the openldap-devel package. If the user uninstalled openldap-devel, the symbolic links were broken and the ""rpm -V openldap"" command sometimes produced errors. With this update, the symbolic links no longer get broken in the described situation. If the user downgrades openldap to version 2.4.39-6 or earlier, the symbolic links might break. After such downgrade, it is recommended to verify that the symbolic links did not break. To do this, make sure the yum-plugin-verify package is installed and obtain the target libraries by running the ""rpm -V openldap"" or ""yum verify openldap"" command. (BZ#1230263) In addition, this update adds the following enhancement: * OpenLDAP clients now automatically choose the Network Security Services (NSS) default cipher suites for communication with the server. It is no longer necessary to maintain the default cipher suites manually in the OpenLDAP source code. (BZ#1245279) All openldap users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues and add this enhancement."

CVE-2017-3737 openssl-libs 1:1.0.1e-42.el7.9 MEDIUM "OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an ""error state"" mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected."

CVE-2019-13565 openldap 2.4.39-6.el7 LOW "An issue was discovered in OpenLDAP 2.x before 2.4.48. When using SASL authentication and session encryption, and relying on the SASL security layers in slapd access controls, it is possible to obtain access that would otherwise be denied via a simple bind for any identity covered in those ACLs. After the first SASL bind is completed, the sasl_ssf value is retained for all new non-SASL connections. Depending on the ACL configuration, this can affect different types of operations (searches, modifications, etc.). In other words, a successful authorization step completed by one user affects the authorization requirement for a different user."
