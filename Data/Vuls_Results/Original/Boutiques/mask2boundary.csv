CveID Packages PackageVer "CVSS (AC)" Summary
CVE-2018-14048 libpng 1.6.35-r0- MEDIUM "An issue has been found in libpng 1.6.34. It is a SEGV in the function png_free_data in png.c, related to the recommended error handling for png_read_image."
CVE-2018-14550 libpng 1.6.35-r0- MEDIUM "An issue has been found in third-party PNM decoding associated with libpng 1.6.35. It is a stack-based buffer overflow in the function get_token in pnm2png.c in pnm2png."
CVE-2018-14647 python2 2.7.15-r3- LOW "Python's elementtree C accelerator failed to initialise Expat's hash salt during initialization. This could make it easy to conduct denial of service attacks against Expat by constructing an XML document that would cause pathological hash collisions in Expat's internal data structures, consuming large amounts CPU and RAM. Python 3.8, 3.7, 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 2.7 are believed to be vulnerable."
CVE-2018-20843 expat 2.2.6-r0- LOW "In libexpat in Expat before 2.2.7, XML input including XML names that contain a large number of colons could make the XML parser consume a high amount of RAM and CPU resources while processing (enough to be usable for denial-of-service attacks)."
CVE-2019-7317 libpng 1.6.35-r0- HIGH "png_image_free in png.c in libpng 1.6.x before 1.6.37 has a use-after-free because png_image_free_function is called under png_safe_execute."
CVE-2019-8904 file 5.35-r0- MEDIUM "do_bid_note in readelf.c in libmagic.a in file 5.35 has a stack-based buffer over-read, related to file_printf and file_vprintf."
CVE-2019-8905 file 5.35-r0- MEDIUM "do_core_note in readelf.c in libmagic.a in file 5.35 has a stack-based buffer over-read, related to file_printable, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-10360."
CVE-2019-8906 file 5.35-r0- MEDIUM "do_core_note in readelf.c in libmagic.a in file 5.35 has an out-of-bounds read because memcpy is misused."
CVE-2019-8907 file 5.35-r0- MEDIUM "do_core_note in readelf.c in libmagic.a in file 5.35 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact."
CVE-2019-9636 python2 2.7.15-r3- LOW "Python 2.7.x through 2.7.16 and 3.x through 3.7.2 is affected by: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly."
CVE-2019-9948 python2 2.7.15-r3- LOW "urllib in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call."
