---------------------------------
CVE-2018-20060 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20060
urllib3 before version 1.23 does not remove the Authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the Authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext.


CVE-2019-11236 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11236
In the urllib3 library through 1.24.1 for Python, CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls the request parameter.


openldap - 2.4.31-1+nmu2ubuntu8.4
---------------------------------
CVE-2017-14159 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-14159
slapd in OpenLDAP 2.4.45 and earlier creates a PID file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for PID file modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat /pathname`" command, as demonstrated by openldap-initscript.


CVE-2019-13057 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-13057
An issue was discovered in the server in OpenLDAP before 2.4.48. When the server administrator delegates rootDN (database admin) privileges for certain databases but wants to maintain isolation (e.g., for multi-tenant deployments), slapd does not properly stop a rootDN from requesting authorization as an identity from another database during a SASL bind or with a proxyAuthz (RFC 4370) control. (It is not a common configuration to deploy a system where the server administrator and a DB administrator enjoy different levels of trust.)


CVE-2019-13565 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-13565
An issue was discovered in OpenLDAP 2.x before 2.4.48. When using SASL authentication and session encryption, and relying on the SASL security layers in slapd access controls, it is possible to obtain access that would otherwise be denied via a simple bind for any identity covered in those ACLs. After the first SASL bind is completed, the sasl_ssf value is retained for all new non-SASL connections. Depending on the ACL configuration, this can affect different types of operations (searches, modifications, etc.). In other words, a successful authorization step completed by one user affects the authorization requirement for a different user.


curl - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.19
-------------------------
CVE-2019-3823 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3823
libcurl versions from 7.34.0 to before 7.64.0 are vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds read in the code handling the end-of-response for SMTP. If the buffer passed to `smtp_endofresp()` isn't NUL terminated and contains no character ending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5, then the `strtol()` call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents will not be returned to the caller.


CVE-2016-8625 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8625
curl before version 7.51.0 uses outdated IDNA 2003 standard to handle International Domain Names and this may lead users to potentially and unknowingly issue network transfer requests to the wrong host.


CVE-2019-5436 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-5436
A heap buffer overflow in the TFTP receiving code allows for DoS or arbitrary code execution in libcurl versions 7.19.4 through 7.64.1.


ntp - 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.13
---------------------------------------

ntpd in ntp 4.2.x before 4.2.8p7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92 allows authenticated users that know the private symmetric key to create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify a victim's clock via a Sybil attack. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1549.


CVE-2018-12327 (Negligible)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12327
Stack-based buffer overflow in ntpq and ntpdc of NTP version 4.2.8p11 allows an attacker to achieve code execution or escalate to higher privileges via a long string as the argument for an IPv4 or IPv6 command-line parameter. NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any common situations in which ntpq or ntpdc is used with a command line from an untrusted source.


bzip2 - 1.0.6-5
---------------
CVE-2019-12900 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12900

An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.3. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue.


CVE-2019-9636 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9636
Python 2.7.x through 2.7.16 and 3.x through 3.7.2 is affected by: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly.


CVE-2018-1060 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1060
python before versions 2.7.15, 3.4.9, 3.5.6rc1, 3.6.5rc1 and 3.7.0 is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking in pop3lib's apop() method.  An attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service.


CVE-2018-1000030 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1000030
Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a Heap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.


CVE-2018-1000802 (Medium)

-----------------------------
CVE-2013-4235 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4235
TOCTOU race conditions by copying and removing directory trees


CVE-2018-7169 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-7169
An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used "group blacklisting" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.


CVE-2017-12424 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-12424
In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal data structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed input may lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a privilege boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create subaccounts.

nodejs - 6.14.4-1nodesource1
----------------------------
CVE-2018-12121 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12121
Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0 and 11.3.0: Denial of Service with large HTTP headers: By using a combination of many requests with maximum sized headers (almost 80 KB per connection), and carefully timed completion of the headers, it is possible to cause the HTTP server to abort from heap allocation failure. Attack potential is mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer.


CVE-2018-7158 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-7158
The `'path'` module in the Node.js 4.x release line contains a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, `splitPathRe`, used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`, `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.


CVE-2018-12115 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12115
In all versions of Node.js prior to 6.14.4, 8.11.4 and 10.9.0 when used with UCS-2 encoding (recognized by Node.js under the names `'ucs2'`, `'ucs-2'`, `'utf16le'` and `'utf-16le'`), `Buffer#write()` can be abused to write outside of the bounds of a single `Buffer`. Writes that start from the second-to-last position of a buffer cause a miscalculation of the maximum length of the input bytes to be written.


CVE-2018-12123 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12123
Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0 and 11.3.0: Hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol: If a Node.js application is using url.parse() to determine the URL hostname, that hostname can be spoofed by using a mixed case "javascript:" (e.g. "javAscript:") protocol (other protocols are not affected). If security decisions are made about the URL based on the hostname, they may be incorrect.


CVE-2016-2086 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2086

CVE-2016-7099 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7099
The tls.checkServerIdentity function in Node.js 0.10.x before 0.10.47, 0.12.x before 0.12.16, 4.x before 4.6.0, and 6.x before 6.7.0 does not properly handle wildcards in name fields of X.509 certificates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a crafted certificate.


CVE-2016-2216 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2216
The HTTP header parsing code in Node.js 0.10.x before 0.10.42, 0.11.6 through 0.11.16, 0.12.x before 0.12.10, 4.x before 4.3.0, and 5.x before 5.6.0 allows remote attackers to bypass an HTTP response-splitting protection mechanism via UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters in the HTTP header, as demonstrated by %c4%8d%c4%8a.


CVE-2018-12122 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12122
Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0 and 11.3.0: Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service: An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending headers very slowly keeping HTTP or HTTPS connections and associated resources alive for a long period of time.


CVE-2018-7159 (Low)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-7159
The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the `Content-Length` header, allowing input such as `Content-Length: 1 2` to be interpreted as having a value of `12`. The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this particular difference. The security risk of this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it is difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of this flaw in a way that could not already be achieved by supplying an incorrect value for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code that make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this value compared to the actual length of the data supplied. Node.js users crafting lower-level HTTP utilities are advised to re-check the length of any input supplied after parsing is complete.

CVE-2019-1559 (Medium)
http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-1559
If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).

dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, as used in DBusServer in Canonical Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, less common, uses of dbus-daemon), allows cookie spoofing because of symlink mishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the libdbus library. (This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.
