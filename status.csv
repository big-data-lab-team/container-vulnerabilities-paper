"It means ’Does Not Exist’. The package (inside the
given release) does not exist in the archive.","The vulnerability of this package (inside the
given release) is not known. It needs to be evaluated. (No
version/notes)","The package (inside the given release), while
related to the CVE in some way, is not affected by the issue.
Notes should provide detailed information if needed. For e.g if
the given status is ""not-affected (1.14.6-1.1)"" then it indicates
that this specific package version in the given release is not
affected","The package (inside the given release) is vulnerable
to the CVE and needs to be fixed.","The package (inside the given release) is vulnerable
to the CVE, needs fixing, and is actively being worked on.","The package (inside the given release), while re-
lated to the CVE in some way, is being ignored for some rea-
son. The notes should provide that reason. For e.g if status
looks like ""ignored (reached end-of-life)"", this means that
this given Ubuntu release already reached end-of-life so this
CVE is ignored by Ubuntu. However, if there is extended secu-
rity support for this release then this CVE will be handled in
ESM release.","The package (inside the given release) is vulnera-
ble and has been fixed but an update has not been yet uploaded
or published. The package version that contains the fix is also
along with the status.","The package (inside the given release) is vulner-
able, but its fix has been deferred for some reason. The notes
should provide further details. If a date is mentioned eg ""de-
ferred (2015-02-02)"" this date specifies the date when the CVE
was deferred.","The package (inside the given release) was vul-
nerable, but an update has been already uploaded and pub-
lished. The package version is also mentioned. For e.g ""re-
leased (1.2.3)"" specifies the package version in which the fix
first appeared.","The package (inside the given release) was
vulnerable and an update has been already uploaded and pub-
lished. However, this update is published in the Ubuntu ESM release only and not in LTS. The fixed version of such packages
is appended by +esmN or ~esm, indicating that this package
version is available only via ESM."
